<h2 id="spring-style-guide-goal-audience">The Goal and the Audience</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When writing about Spring, remember that the goal is to get information from the document
into the reader&#8217;s head. Few people read technical documentation for fun or are going to
admire the quality of your prose, no matter how good it is. However, if you can quickly
teach them useful things, they are likely to think the documentation is wonderful.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Also, remember that people with a wide range of backgrounds and abilities use Spring.
People with doctoral degrees in Computer Science and high school kids who want to join the
profession both use Spring, and we need to think of them and everyone in between when we
write about Spring. We also have readers from all over the world, and English is not the
first language for many of them. They may be good with English, but it is never quite the
same as one&#8217;s native language.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To serve all those different people well, one crucial bit of advice is to keep things
simple. Prefer shorter sentences to longer sentences and shorter words to longer words.
Prefer multiple short sentences to one long sentence. This document returns to each of
these points in detail.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Above all, remember that the goal is to help people from all kinds of backgrounds learn to
use Spring.</p>

Remember that not everyone who reads our documentation knows Spring. Some readers are
new to all of Spring. Consequently, if you find yourself writing phrases such as "as
Spring usually works" or "as customary" or anything else that implies the user is familiar
with Spring, rewrite that content such that the reader need not know anything about
any part of Spring. Doing so often forces the inclusion of more detail and links to other
content, both of which suit our purpose.

<h2 id="spring-style-guide-titles">Titles and Subtitles</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A title tells its reader what a document is about. Ideally, it should be followed by a
paragraph that identifies both the audience and the purpose of the document, so that
readers can be sure they want to spend their time reading the document. The first
paragraph of this document offers an example.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You should generally use title case, which means capitalizing the first letter of all
significant words (all words that are not articles, conjunctions, or prepositions).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can put code in a title. When you use code in a title, capitalize the code element as
you would in the actual code. (See <a href="#spring-style-guide-source-code-listings">Source Code Listings</a>.)</p>

<h2 id="spring-style-guide-headings">Headings</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Headings break up documents into meaningful chunks. Small documents may not have any
headings. When the entire document deals with a single concept, the title may be all the
heading it needs. However, most technical documents benefit from being broken into
meaningful chunks.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Spring documentation uses the various heading levels as follows:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Heading level 1: Indicates a major chunk within a document. Each one should be an
important topic in its own right.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Heading level 2: Deals with something significant within a broader concept (which should
be the level-1 heading above the level-2 heading).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Heading level 3: In larger documents, deals with something significant within a broader
concept (which should be the level-2 heading above the level-3 heading). In a smaller
document, this level deals with a meaningful detail.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Heading level 4: Deals with a meaningful detail in a larger document. This level should
be avoided in small documents.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Heading level 5: Should be avoided. May deal with a minor detail in a large document.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Level-1 headings often contain content that could reasonably be a document in its
own right. The same is sometimes true of level-2 headings. Level-3 and level-4 headings
should not contain content so significant that it could be its own document. If you find
that your level-3 (or, worse, level-4) headings can reasonably be documents on their own,
you should consider restructuring the document. It may benefit from being split into
multiple chapters or other documents.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Level-2 and Level-3 (and, rarely, level-4) headings sometimes serve as containers for
collections of lesser headings. That is, the point of the heading may be to have a single
heading for a number of parallel blocks of content.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonitionblock important">
<table>
<tr>
<td class="icon">
<i class="fa icon-important" title="Important"></i>
</td>
<td class="content">
A heading of any level should always have a lead paragraph (and often other
content) before any child headings. In other words, you should never have a heading and
then a child heading without intervening content, even if that content is a one-sentence
paragraph. (A one-sentence leader paragraph often occurs when a heading is a container for
a number of child headings of the same level.)

Ideally, a level-1 heading (and sometimes a level-2 heading) and its content can be
reused either as a stand-alone document or in another document. Consequently, you should
try to make the content of each of these sections make sense by itself, without the reader
needing to know what comes before or after it. People often jump into a document in the
middle, by searching for keywords or following links from elsewhere. Also, self-contained
writing is often better writing (because it usually requires more consideration of the
reader&#8217;s needs).

<h2 id="spring-style-guide-lists">Lists</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Lists are a handy way to group items that share a relation. In other words, every item in
the list must have something in common with the other members. You should use a list when
describing the items in a single sentence becomes awkward, either because the sentence
becomes overly long or because each item has its own internal punctuation.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonitionblock important">
<table>
<tr>
<td class="icon">
<i class="fa icon-important" title="Important"></i>
</td>
<td class="content">
Each list should have a lead paragraph (a paragraph that introduces the list,
often by describing the connection between its items).
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, this sentence does not need to be restructured, because it contains a simple
list of red, blue, and green. However, this sentence should be restructured, because it
contains a complex list of green, blue and yellow, purple, red and blue, and orange, red
and yellow. The list in the preceding sentence should be written as the following
bulleted list:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Green: Blue and yellow.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Purple: Red and blue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Orange: Red and yellow.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In a list, you should capitalize the first letter of the first word in each list item. If
you use a separator (such as the colons in the preceding example), you should generally
capitalize the first letter of the first word after the separator. However, if the word in
question must be a literal of some sort, capitalize the literal as you would in its
natural context. For example, if your list item starts with a snippet of code, you should
not change the code&#8217;s capitalization. (See <a href="#spring-style-guide-source-code-listings">Source Code Listings</a>.)</p>

<div class="admonitionblock tip">

<td class="icon">
<i class="fa icon-tip" title="Tip"></i>

<td class="content">
One good reason to use a list is to reduce extra wording around the list items
(by removing any introductory bits within each list item). A well written list can help
readers get content from a document more quickly.
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When the order of a list matters, use a numbered list. Usually, in documentation for
software development, a numbered list is either a set of instructions or an algorithm.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonitionblock tip">
<table>
<tr>
<td class="icon">
<i class="fa icon-tip" title="Tip"></i>
</td>
<td class="content">
You should avoid numbered lists when the order does not matter, because you may
needlessly force the reader to consider a detail (the order) that does not matter.
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For bulleted lists and numbered lists that are not instructions, you can embed lists
within lists. Instructions follow different rules. Instructions with more than one step
should always be numbered and should always be presented as a list. Also, instructions
should never contain embedded lists (lists within lists). If you need to have a second set
of instructions within a set of instructions, create three sets of instructions: one for
the instructions down to the embedded instructions, one for the embedded instructions, and
one for the remainder of the "outer" instructions. Also, each list should have its own
lead paragraph. (That may seem like a lot of extra work, but it pays for itself in reduced
error rates for the readers and fewer support tickets for the developers.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Ordinary lists rarely get titles or their own headings. However, instructions often get
headings.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As a rule, you should avoid using bold or italics in lists. See
<a href="#spring-style-guide-highlighting">Highlighting</a>.</p>

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="spring-style-guide-tables">Tables</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Like lists, tables group items so that similarities and differences and key information
about each item can be presented with a minimum of extra wording. Also like lists, each
item in a table should share some relation with the other items. Also, a leader paragraph
should introduce the table by defining the connection between the items.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You should use a table rather than a list when each item has multiple relevant attributes.
If the table shows an item and one detail about each item, reformat the table into a list
with a separator. (That simpler structure is faster for readers.) However, when you have
two or more attributes to present for each item, use a table.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonitionblock tip">
<table>
<tr>
<td class="icon">
<i class="fa icon-tip" title="Tip"></i>

Tables are especially good for presenting sparse information (when not every item in
the collection has all the attributes). The empty cells make it immediately apparent which
items do and do not have the various attributes.
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As a rule, the items are the rows, and the attributes are the columns. If that is not the
case, you should probably add a note to explain to the reader how to read the table.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Tables often have titles. Adding a title helps to clarify the purpose of the table and
enables letting the list be stand-alone content when readers are quickly skimming a
document.</p>

<h2 id="spring-style-guide-source-code-listings">Source Code Listings</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Source code listings come in two varieties: inline and block. Inline listings are handy
when you want to mention a bit of code in a sentence or a title (either the document title
or a heading). Block listings let you show larger sections of code so that the reader can
see the code in context and more readily understand it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Usually, we do not remove lines from code to shorten listings. If you need to do so, you
should probably have two listings, each with its own description. If you need to highlight
certain lines within a listing, you can do so by making one or more lines bold or by using
callouts. When you do need to use multiple listings to show something, each listing has to
have its own explanation. Also, do not try to use part of a sentence before a listing and
continue the rest of the sentence after the listing. That creates one or more sentence
fragments, which violates Spring&#8217;s documentation standard. Also, providing more detail can
help to answer the reader&#8217;s questions.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonitionblock important">
<table>
<tr>
<td class="icon">
<i class="fa icon-important" title="Important"></i>
</td>
<td class="content">
When you use code inline, the code&#8217;s formatting overrides any other formatting
rules, such as capitalizing words in titles and headings. Also, you should never change
code to make a word be plural. For example, if you were describing a set of <code>Item</code>
objects, it would be an error to write " <code>Items</code> " or " <code>Item</code> s ". Instead, you should
write " <code>Item</code> objects ". (Sometimes, the correct word is "implementations" or "instances"
rather than "objects".) In short, you should never indicate that something is source code
unless it can be found in the code base exactly as it appears in the document.

<h2 id="spring-style-guide-links">Links and Anchors</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As a rule, you should be aggressive about making links to other documents, both other
documents within Spring and other documents outside of Spring. If you do so, readers can
more readily discover related content. Also, you should link to different kinds of content
whenever appropriate. Feel free to link from a reference guide to a getting start guide,
API documentation, or a tutorial and to link from any of those to the other types. If in
doubt, make a link.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Similarly, you should arrange your content to be easy to use as the target of links. To
that end, every level-1 and level-2 heading should have an anchor, so that other documents
can include a link to that point in your document. Many other headings (level-3 and
level-4 headings) should also have anchors. When you add an anchor, make sure that the
content of the section makes sense without the reader having read the preceding and
following content. In other words, make your sections each be complete, so that linking to
them provides a good experience for readers. If in doubt, make an anchor and make the
topic be able to stand alone.</p>

<p>Images offer a way to show relationships that are either difficult to make apparent with
words or that would take a lot of work for the writer to explain and for the reader to
understand. Images may also be used to add visual appeal, though the content of an image
should always be relevant to the content of the paragraphs around it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As with lists and tables and the content under headings, every image should have a lead
paragraph to summarize its meaning. Also, images should often have titles. For readers who
may be quickly skimming the document, a title offers immediate context that helps them to
understand the image&#8217;s content and may encourage them to read more of the document.
Consequently, the more significant the image is to your content, the more you should
consider adding a title to your image. If an image explains a core concept, you might
consider giving it its own heading. In that case, it should still have an introductory
paragraph and a title.</p>

<h2 id="spring-style-guide-maintaining-flow">Maintaining the Flow</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One goal of technical documentation is to make the content engaging. One way to do that is
to create structures that draw the reader into reading the next part of the documentation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To that end, the Spring documentation standard requires leader paragraphs for every list,
table, code listing, and image (as well as every heading whose purpose is to be a group
name for a set of child headings at the same level). Usually, the leader paragraph should
be a single sentence that describes the content to come and includes the word,
"following."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Similarly, using short phrases (such as "As shown earlier") or sentence adverbs (such as
"Also" and "However") links one paragraph to another and both shows the relationship
between the content of the paragraphs and encourages the reader to continue.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In short, you should try to show the relationships between pieces of content, even at the
paragraph level, Often, it is easy to overuse the technique, but it is a worthwhile
technique to keep in your writing toolbox.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="spring-style-guide-writing-sentences">Writing Sentences</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Do not write sentence fragments. For example, do not write, "For example.", as a sentence
by itself and then follow it with the example. Work "for example" into a complete
sentence.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Use short sentences. People parse shorter sentences more quickly than they do longer
sentences. You can literally get readers through your content more quickly if you use
shorter sentences. You should link sentences with connected ideas by using short
introductory phrases or sentence adverbs. "Also" and "however" let you continue a complex
thought across two short sentences or add a contradictory detail to a preceding detail,
respectively. Also, do not write whole sentences as parenthetical phrases, whether in
parentheses or otherwise. Put the parenthetical content in its own sentence. Note that
parenthetical phrases are often set apart with commas.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Avoid semi-colons. Used properly, a semi-colon links two independent clauses. That is, the
words on each side of a semi-colon can themselves be a sentence. In those cases, you
should use two shorter sentences, perhaps with an introductory phrase or sentence adverb
at the start of the second sentence.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Avoid dashes. In almost every case where you can use a dash, there is another punctuation
mark you should use instead. Creating a parenthetical phrase? Use commas (if the sentence
does not already have commas) or parentheses. Creating a parenthetical phrase within other
parenthetical content? Stop doing that and restructure the sentence into multiple simple
sentences. Making separators in a bulleted or numbered list? Use colons. Making separators
in a bulleted or numbered list whose items already have colons? That is the only use case
for dashes.</p>

<p>Except when serving as separators in lists, a colon must be preceded by an independent
clause. In other words, the part before the colon must be able to be a sentence if you
replace the colon with a period. Specifically, do not write, "For example:".</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Put conditional phrases first. Consider the following sentence: "You can use the <code>new</code>
keyword if you want to make a new instance of a class." The trouble with it is that
someone has to read all of it to determine whether its content is relevant to their
situation. By putting the conditional part of the sentence first, you can help readers
through the document more quickly by letting them identify whether they care about the
second half of the sentence. To that end, the sentence should be re-written as follows:
"To make a new instance of a class, use the <code>new</code> keyword."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Also, note that the second sentence is shorter. "If you want" and "You can" were
unnecessary (in either version). Trimming out unnecessary words offers another good way to
improve the reader&#8217;s experience with the document.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>In short, keep the writing simple. By doing so, you make things better for Spring&#8217;s
readers.</p>

<h3 id="spring-style-guide-highlighting">Highlighting</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It can be tempting to highlight important words, often by capitalizing, underlining, or
using bold. However, the Spring documentation standard calls for not doing so.
Highlighting with any of those techniques makes the reader&#8217;s eye jump to the highlighted
content, breaking the flow of their reading and forcing them to re-read sentences. In
other words, highlighting slows down reading and makes the document less friendly to our
readers. If you must highlight something, do so sparingly.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Mosts lists should also not have highlighting, other than to capitalize the first word of
each list item and the first word after a separator within a list item. However,
definition lists may have the word (or short phrase) being defined in bold, especially if
the definition is on a different line than the word being defined.</p>

<dt class="hdlist1">"foo" and "bar"</dt>
<dd>
<p>"foo" and "bar" are often used in sample code. Doing so is a mistake for
two reasons. First, more meaningful examples are more helpful. For example, a line of code
showing how to define two caches would be better written as <code>cache1,cache2</code> than as
<code>foo,bar</code>. When referring to the same example later in the document, the reader is more
likely to remember that the section is about caches and not have to go look at the example
again. Second, "foo" and "bar" are based on a phrase that contains a curse word. While
they have been used for decades, they are based on a crass joke (and often an inside joke
at that, with the people using them often not knowing their history). That kind of
juvenile behavior is inappropriate in good technical documentation.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">"terminate"</dt>
<dd>
<p>Write, "end," instead. "End" is shorter and simpler. Also, "terminate" has
violent connotations, and good technical documentation avoids that. Remember that people
from many cultures read Spring&#8217;s documentation and that some people are more disturbed by
violence than others.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">"execute"</dt>
<dd>
<p>Write, "run," instead. "Run" is shorter and simpler. Also, "execute" has
violent connotations and is politically charged in some cultures. Good technical
documentation avoids both problems. Remember that people from many cultures read Spring&#8217;s
documentation and that some people are more disturbed by violence than others.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">"abort"</dt>
<dd>
<p>Write, "stop," instead. "Stop" is shorter and simpler. Also, "abort" has
violent connotations and is politically charged in some cultures. Good technical
documentation avoids both problems. Remember that people from many cultures read Spring&#8217;s
documentation and that some people are more disturbed by violence than others.</p>

Using "end," "run,", and "stop" is good for two other reasons: Doing so reduces the
number of Latin cognates in the document, relying on plain English words. Relying on words
that have not been borrowed from other languages simplifies the document and improves
understanding, especially for readers whose first language is not English. Second, if
someone translates the documentation, the plain English words are easier to correctly
translate. Translators often do not have programming backgrounds and are more likely to
mis-translate more complicated terms.

<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">"then"</dt>
<dd>
<p>"Then" is not a conjunction. The following sentence is incorrect: "Put on your
socks then your shoes." In that sentence, "then" is an adverb, not a conjunction that can
link the two parts of the process. The correct sentence is: "Put on your socks and then
your shoes." Note the addition of a conjunction: "and."</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">"if&#8230;&#8203;then&#8230;&#8203;"</dt>
<dd>
<p>You can nearly always drop "then" in a sentence that contains an
"if&#8230;&#8203;then&#8230;&#8203;" clause. In English, as in Java, "then" is implied, and the meaning usually
remains clear without it. Consider the following sentence: "If you are going to the store,
then pick up some milk." Without losing meaning, it can be rewritten as "If you are going
to the store, pick up some milk."</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">"will" and the future tense</dt>
<dd>
<p>Avoid the future tense (often created by the insertion of
"will"). Usually, the rest of the document is in the present tense. For consistency&#8217;s
sake, keep it that way. Also, in some documents, it is easy to accidentally promise
something, which can put the team in an awkward spot. (The latter is especially true in
documents such as release notes.) Finally, sentences can often be shorter when kept in the
present tense.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">"above" and "below"</dt>
<dd>
<p>The trouble with referring to the earlier part of the document as
"above" and the later part of the document as "below" is that we have no idea where the
page breaks may land when someone prints the document or renders it into a paged format
(such as PDF). It is entirely possible for the "below" part referenced in the sentence to
be above the current location but on the next page. Rather, write, "earlier" and "later."
Also, when referring to an example that immediately precedes the paragraph, write,
"preceding example."</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">"just"</dt>
<dd>
<p>In many cases, you can remove "just" from a sentence without changing its
meaning. In those cases, you should remove it.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">"very"</dt>
<dd>
<p>"Very" can nearly always be removed without changing the meaning of the sentence.
In those cases, you should remove it.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">"simply", "easily", "obviously", and so on</dt>
<dd>
<p>Avoid these words and any other words that
imply something is simple, easy, or obvious. For someone new to Spring, the task or issue
at hand may not be simple, easy, or obvious. Remember to put yourself in the reader&#8217;s
place when writing. Something that is simple, easy, or obvious to someone who works on
Spring all the time is probably not any of those things to a new Spring developer. If it
were simple, easy, or obvious, would they be reading the documentation?</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>If a number is ten or less and is a positive integer, write it as a word. Otherwise, write
it as a number. Specifically, you should write it as a number, rather than write it as a
word, when its value is less than zero or greater than ten, it contains a mathematical
constant, or it is anything other than an integer. The following examples are all correct:
<code>zero</code>, <code>one</code>, <code>two</code>, <code>ten</code>, <code>11</code>, <code>12</code>, <code>20</code>, <code>30</code>, <code>-0</code>, <code>-1</code>, <code>-2</code>, <code>-10</code>, <code>-20</code>,
<code>0.0</code>, <code>0.1</code>, <code>1.0</code>, <code>-1.0</code>, <code>2.3</code>, <code>-2.3</code>, <code>i</code>, <code>-i</code>, <code>-2i</code>, <code>e</code>, <code>-e</code>, and <code>-2e</code>.</p>

Avoid using symbols that are more complex than a single letter in the English
alphabet (such as <code>i</code> and <code>e</code>). Some rendering engines may not correctly render the
symbol, leaving the reader wondering what the symbol was meant to be (or, worse, thinking
it is some other symbol). In those cases, write Java code that means the same thing. For
example, to express the square root of three, write, <code>MATH.sqrt(3)</code>, because <code>√3</code> may not
render correctly.
